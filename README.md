# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions for the [2020 edition of the Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) (if you have never heard of it before, it is an online challenge where a new algorithmic problem comes out every day of the Advent, and you have to solve it as quickly as possible).

I decided to add some more difficulty to the challenge for me (as if it wasn't already hard enough) by coding all my solutions in C++ (I did it in [Python last year](https://github.com/ErwanDL/aoc2019), which is arguably much easier to work with for algorithms). The 2 reasons for this are : improving my C++ skills and knowledge of the standard library ; C++ can have significantly better performance than Python at runtime, which can be useful for some problems.
